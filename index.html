      <div class="header">SCOPE Portal - Design Document</div>
      <div class="sub-header">Elias Lee - Sole Developer</div>
      <div class="text">Student Clinical Opportunities for Premedical Experience (SCOPE) is a student-run organization based out of Stanford University that focuses on creating a shared community for anyone interested in medicine or pursuing a career in medicine. A big reason why volunteers come to SCOPE, however, is for the volunteering opportunity in the Emergency Department (ED) at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center (SCVMC) in San Jose.</div>
      <div class="text">Monthly shift schedules for physicians at the SCVMC ED are sent to SCOPE as a JPEG file the month prior. After that it is up to volunteers in the organization to set up a way for members to sign up for shifts and reference the results at a later time. When I joined, shift sign-ups were clunky and unwieldy, both for members to use and for the web team to set up every month. Due to the nature of the problem, there was a need for a novel solution to automate the process.</div>
      <div class="text">My dissatisfaction with the existing system led me to create SCOPE Portal, a members-only platform where the process of inputting shift data and signing up for shifts could be streamlined. In this document I’ll recount the development process of the application as well as some of the design decisions I made.</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="header">The Problem</div>
      <div class="text">When I first joined, Eventbrite was the go-to method for shift sign-ups. This meant that an individual had to manually input each physician’s name for each shift of each day of the month as options while referencing the monthly schedule. Not only was this process tedious and time-consuming, it had to be done each month.</div>
      <div class="text">Furthermore, it’s not hard to imagine that using Eventbrite’s form style was unintuitive. Scrolling down a ~240 entry list (8 shifts per day, ~30 days per month) made it difficult to visualize planning your schedule.</div>
      <div class="text">This form factor meant that users signing up for a shift had to open the schedule JPEG file if they wanted to see the month’s schedule before scanning the form’s list of shifts.</div>
      <div class="text">And if the shift had already been filled by another volunteer? One would inevitably reference the monthly schedule again to find another shift they wanted before returning to the Eventbrite link. Not good, especially on mobile.</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="header">The Problem: Part 2</div>
      <div class="text">A resourceful volunteer at SCOPE helped us transition from Eventbrite to JotForm. This eliminated the need to manually populate the next month’s shifts, and whoever was in charge of setting up just had to label each day of the month the same 8 shifts available at the hospital. The form was still a ~240 entry list that the user had to scroll through, but we were at least making gains on the burden of setup.</div>
      <div class="text">As before, when volunteers sign up for shifts, they could see which shifts previous users had already signed-up for.</div>
      <div class="text">However, because JotForm lacks the capability to export form submissions to Google Calendar—something Eventbrite had—users were put through a second step. They had to manually populate the day, the time, the location, and the physician assigned to each shift they signed up for. Worse yet, users could not see what they had signed up for on the previous page, forcing them to remember details of their selection.</div>
      <div class="text">The result of this was a 2-page form that from the perspective of the user had terrible UI/UX Even though creating the form was simplified for management, pushing the effort onto the users felt like we had taken a step back to square one.</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="header">The Beginning</div>
      <div class="text">For the longest time I had my sights set on creating a user portal that would serve as a centralized hub for information and, better yet, shift sign-ups. Such an application would require authentication and possibly roles. Also I would somehow automate or streamline the process of uploading the hospital shift information and build a UI that was both easy to use and easy on the eyes.</div>
      <div class="text">Beyond this, I had some consideration in mind. I knew that if I were to implement any sort of application for the organization, it would have to:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Be either so reliable that failure was not even a possibility, or if it failed it did not break existing methods in place. I chose to be backwards compatible, the application would be an abstraction layer, meaning if the service went down and I was not available to fix things, operations could continue as they did before.</li>
        <li>Be stupid easy upkeep, so that SCOPE applicants don’t have to be selected for their coding abilities. The manner in which the application ingested its data would have to be designed in such a way that anyone, with or without a background in tech, could jump in and take over tasks.</li>
        <li>Be simplistic. There’s a difference between an instruction list that is easy to follow once you understand it, and one that is easy to follow right off the bat. To me this meant that how I designed the application and the maintenance process had to make sense and had to be straightforward. The fewer the steps, the easier each step, the better.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="text">Lastly, I won’t bore you with the details of the boilerplate, so what I used to set up my application is as follows:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Client-Side Bundling: create-react-app</li>
        <li>Server: Express.js</li>
        <li>Authentication: Firebase</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="text">I selected each for the simplicity of implementation and based on my experience with React and Express.</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="header">The Lesson</div>
      <div class="text">I was ready to build the entire application, so the first thing I set up was the login page and the Firebase SDK to manage users. Soon I found myself in the weeds considering everything about managing the user’s experience and how I would implement it:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Is the user going to want a ‘Remember me?’ or ‘Keep me logged in’ option?</li>
        <li>What if the user navigates away only to return soon after and have to re-login?</li>
        <li>How am I going to ensure that users can’t navigate to the app’s internal pages wrongfully?</li>
        <li>Do I want to bootstrap by building auth-related features in the code? Or should I do things properly with tokens?</li>
        <li>Where is the Firebase SDK going to exist? Do we want the front-end or the back-end to be responsible?</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="text">These were only a few of the matters that I simultaneously thought about and struggled with initially. The worst part was that I tried building out each feature, for the sake of the user, without having a clear focus on how I wanted to design the infrastructure. Before accomplishing what set out to do in the name of “good UX”, I was left with a simple looking login page that led to a blank page that just said ‘Home’.</div>
      <div class="text">I realized at this point that I had never truly understood one of the tenets that lives at the intersection of good software engineering and prudent product management:</div>
      <div class="text">Don’t over-engineer something before you’ve proven its value.</div>
      <div class="text">I was so used to working on projects that had clear product and design goals, which meant I just had to carry out the implementation. So I asked myself, why was I spending so much time on authentication when I didn’t know if I could even automate uploading monthly schedules? After all, I knew my front-end chops were fine and that building login features and the user interface was going to happen one way or another. The core question I wanted to answer was whether or not I could actually automate setting up monthly shifts, so I set out to answer that first.</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="header">The Algorithm</div>
      <div class="text">My first task was to figure out a way to parse the image of the monthly physician schedule. If I was to pass on this project to future cycles of volunteers, I wanted a reliable solution that was trustworthy and did not require the user to remember a long URL or to dig into documentation to find.</div>
      <div class="text">In the end I discovered that Google Drive allows you to add extensions that can interact with your files. One such extension made it so that you could, once you had an image file in Google Drive, open it in Google Docs, which would automatically parse your image into text.</div>
      <div class="text">I was ready for the next step: writing the code that could format the parsed text into a workable structure. Though I started out writing an algorithm that split the text into each line in the image file, I complicated things by trying to split each line’s contents. Due to the inaccurate and imprecise nature of the image parser, I tried to work around common mistakes I saw in the text output using brute force methods. I tried to find a pattern for issues such as first name initials not getting separated from other doctor’s last names, random text artifacts, and empty space characters.
      </div>
      <div class="text">What I realized, however, was that manipulating the data was unreliable because each individual error could differ just slightly enough from others that no one or two methods could fix them all. Some errors were not addressed at all, and some properly parsed cases were actually messed up by the string manipulation I was doing.</div>
      <div class="text">I had the “Aha!” moment that all engineers have at one point or another, when they realize they had been overthinking the problem the entire time. All I had to do was regex each text line to match physician names that I could save in a constants file. Instead of manipulating the data to scrape off what I didn’t want to keep, I pulled out what I needed, and it proved to be much more reliable in getting the schedule correct and the code was much simpler for it.</div>
      <div class="text">Although there were still some mistakes resulting from errors in the image-to-text parser that could not be ignored, I had a plan for that in the future. For now, I just needed to massage the data and build out the form UI.</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="header">The Form</div>
      <div class="text">I knew that whatever I built would have to be visually intuitive and functionally simple. For the longest time I pictured an interface similar to that of Google Calendar, but when it came to designing I realized the original JPEG format was perfectly fine. Don’t fix what’s not broken right?</div>
      <div class="text">Users could select shifts directly from the calendar while seeing which shifts had already been signed up for.</div>
      <div class="text">After completing the main interface, I threw together other features that needed to exist for the MVP. This included adding the user’s name, email, and roles if they had any.</div>
      <div class="text">I also added a search function so users could pull up shifts they had signed up for.</div>
      <div class="text">Lastly, I created an editing option that transformed each shift entry into a dropdown box. After the user is done fixing the schedule, the resulting text is logged into the console and could be copied and pasted into the codebase.</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="header">Next Steps</div>
      <div class="text">I had a functional, single-page application that allowed users to sign up for shifts and view their shifts, and more importantly for managers to upload monthly schedule information in a mostly automated way. Now that I had a proof of concept, I was ready to throw authentication in front of it and build out the rest of the application.</div>
      <div class="text">The following sections touch upon various implementation or design decisions I made while developing.</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="header">Authentication</div>
      <div class="text">I knew that I wanted the user’s experience to match what one would expect from any well-built site. As such, there were three main features to implement:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>A “Remember me” option on the login page. No one likes having to type in their email every time they come to a website.</li>
        <li>Use JWTs to maintain users’ sessions. Why stop at pre-filling the login form for the user when you can skip logging in entirely?</li>
        <li>Automatically navigate the user to the login page when logged out and to the portal when logged in.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="text">The “Remember me” option saves the user’s login email in the browser’s local storage upon successful login. A JWT from Firebase’s Admin SDK is also saved in local storage to keep the user’s session alive. If the token is present and still valid, the user is automatically logged back in and navigated to the member portal.</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="header">State Management</div>
      <div class="text">For the sake of simplifying the development process, I made the decision to use a single reducer and a single action.</div>
      <div class="text">What this means is that you only ever have to look at your one reducer to understand the structure of your state.</div>
      <div class="text">This also means you don’t have to create dozens of action creators and their accompanying action constants in order to manage all your app’s moving parts.</div>
      <div class="text">The problem with this is that each time you dispatch an action, you have to remember to use the spread operator appropriately so you maintain the data currently existing in each object being changed.</div>
      <div class="text">On the flip side, I find that this setup makes one more aware of the redux state’s structure. It’s easy to lose track of how each object is nested when dealing with multiple reducers. Modularize the actions too far and you start to find yourself declaring keys that match the reducer’s key.</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="header">Design</div>
      <div class="text">I’m no designer, but I’d like to think I have an eye for aesthetics. SCOPE Portal’s colors are based off of the organization’s WordPress site and their logo’s color.</div>
      <div class="text">The user interface is mostly based off of Slack, but is obviously much simpler.</div>
      <div class="text">For the login page I referenced Discord’s, which I’ve always thought was playfully designed and incredibly easy on the eyes. The little interactions that you don’t think about as a user but are everywhere when you’re developing an application are subtle but really complete the whole user experience.</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="header">Components</div>
      <div class="text">I’m a strong believer in using dummy components as I believe it makes it simpler for the developer to make changes when they have to go back into the code. By declaring a single mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps at the parent component, one knows to reference the parent component instead of figuring out the level at which props were declared.</div>
      <div class="text">This also increases code cleanliness by using react-redux’s connect at multiple levels of components. The trade-off is clutter with declaring all the props at each level.</div>
      <div class="text">Although a stable version of the Context API for React had been rolled out at this point (React v16), I did not choose to implement it, choosing to focus on reaching MVP before trying new features. For the unaware, React.createContext allows you to create a context, which acts much like react-redux’s Provider but on the scale of a parent component and its children. This avoids having to explicit pass props at every level between a parent and its great-great-...-grand-child.</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="header">CSS</div>
      <div class="text">For this project I decided to fully implement the Block Element Modifier (BEM) naming convention. In the past I was on the fence about BEM because I always believed that with good classnames other developers can intuitively understand component references and overall component hierarchy. Not to mention, with BEM one can end up with really long classnames that feel excessive and are harder to parse at a glance.</div>
      <div class="text">I ran into an issue where simple naming choices started to overlap between unrelated components and it couldn’t be easily solved by modularizing components into common ones. Accounting for differences between somewhat similar components meant one had to force common components to handle logic and had the potential to bleed complexity into class naming and the style sheets.</div>
      <div class="text">Overall I’m not too satisfied with long BEM classnames but it got the job done namespacing similar components and clarifying what styles applied to which component.</div>
      <div class="text">Although having a separate stylesheet for each component meant some styles were repeated between classes, I felt like it was worth doing so for the sake of development. Changing the design while building out the UI just required finding a component’s CSS file, as opposed to finding a specific class in a larger stylesheet.</div>
      <div class="text">Importing styles within each component also further structured the files within the repository in a predictable manner.</div>
      <div class="text">In deciding how to implement mobile web CSS, I chose to use regex check on navigator.userAgent to find out if the user was on a mobile device. The result was populated into the redux state and passed to components to be used in their class name.</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="header">Static Assets</div>
      <div class="text">Assets included in the repository include:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Monthly schedule data</li>
        <li>JotForm form IDs</li>
        <li>Physician names</li>
        <li>User privileges</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="text">Each month’s schedule and respective JotForm form ID are stored client-side and imported dynamically based on the current date.</div>
      <div class="text">Physician names are stored in a file and must be updated whenever new physicians begin working shifts at the SCVMC.</div>
      <div class="text">User privileges are stored server-side and are passed in the user object in the authentication process.</div>
      <div class="text">Storing our data in this way makes things very explicit and clear while developing and easy to update even without coding experience.</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <div class="header">Conclusion</div>
      <div class="text">With a simple visual comparison we can see that the experience has been improved a lot for the end user.</div>
      <div class="text">And although we increased the work for the user setting up the monthly sign-ups, the automation in the code means the effort required is still not as bad as it was when Eventbrite event forms were used.</div>
      <div class="text">Additional features including shift look-up and deletion greatly add to the experience for volunteers, and also removes the manual work for those managing hospital shift sign-ups.</div>
      <div class="text">One thing I did not mention was the need to control when specific users are allowed to sign up for shifts. Interpreters who translate for Spanish or Vietnamese-speaking only patients at the ED are given priority when signing up for shifts because of their role in helping physicians. Instead of sending emails for shift sign-ups to a specific list of users, one can trust the SCOPE Portal to automatically open scheduling to the users with the appropriate privileges.</div>
      <div class="text">We can also adjust rules for sign-ups, such as requiring translating volunteers to prioritize weekend shifts because professional interpreting services are not available to doctors on weekends.</div>
      <div class="text">Volunteers who are new to the organization are not allowed to sign up for shifts until they have completed their training shifts with veteran volunteers. In the future, the interface can be modified to display the current month’s shifts to allow new volunteers to sign up with trainers without going through hospital coordinators. This would also reduce the workload for those managing shift sign-ups, who have to watch for emails and manually change the schedule as requests come in.</div>
